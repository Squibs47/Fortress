Fortress
========
Baisc game idea:
  Players can place a 'Core' object when they enter, which they then must defend against other players.
  Cores start off with a 300 second immunity, during which time it cannot be damaged, nor their owner damage other cores
  The core generates a low base income of RESOURCE_A, which may be used for basic construction.
  The core acts as a low-level crafting station.
  If the core dies, your progress is reset.
  You may place down other objects within X studs of the core (range may be upgraded)
  Current possible buildings:
    Core
    Power Generator [Type A, Type B, Type, C]
    Auto-Turret [Gun, Laser, Plasma]
    Shield Generator [Mk I, Mk II, Mk III]
    Crafting Station [Mk II, Mk III]
    Building Materials [Basic, Hardened, Reinforced]
      Wall
      Window
      Floor
      Stairs
